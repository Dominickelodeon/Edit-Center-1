  <h2>  My name is Dominic and I like to make edits. I have been working on making edits sense about seventh grade. When starting off I just used a pretty basic app on my phone to add effects and transitions to images (photo video editing). After a while I learned how to get videos into the app and I started video editing.I purchased a few upgrades for the app to make my edits a little better and more lively. I got better the longer I worked even though every single one wasn’t always the best. I also enjoyed/enjoy taking photos and finding cool digital art, because of this I I got new editing apps that I started to use on my phone that worked much better than the other one. Eventually I made a few edits on some real programs like Sony Vegas Pro (svp), Premiere Pro (pp) and others. Now I want to help others with editing things that they enjoy.</h2>
